    <h1 class="title"> Darkest Dungeon </h1>

    <p class="pa ">Darkest Dungeon is a rougelike turn based dungeon crawler, where you create rosters of heros and explore an old mansion that you inherited from one of your ancestors, to figure out what caused the mansion to become infested with evil creatures. It features a unique "stress" mechanic, while your heros are fighting in the dungeon, they take physical health damage, but also stress damage, which can be, in some cases, worse than health damage, so you have to manage your characters mental health and physical health. </p><br>
<div class = "lr">

  <p class="pa l">When heros reach a critial amount of stress, they can gain an affliction (like hopeless, or abusive ) which causes them to being acting unreliably, and often hurting your party members. There is also a small chance that they will instead become virtuous(pictured), and they will resist the stress, and instead gain stat bonuses and inspire the rest of the party. this can change the tide of battle for the better, by allowing a suffering party to rally, and complete a difficult fight, or in the case of an affliction, tear apart a floundering party, so it is a real risk to build to that point. </p><br>

  <p class="pa r">One of the cool things about darkest dungeon, is that it's your story as the inheritor of the dungeon, so individual heros will die, or become afflicted and have to be let go, but the rest of your roster pushes on, waging war against the darkness. You work to upgrade the town that is built around the property where the enemies are, and to discover exactly what happened to make everything on your land the way that it is . </p>
</div><br>
  <p class="pa ll">I would recommend Darkest dungeon to anyone who enjoys slow paced, difficult combat games, where every action could mean the death of heros that you've raised up for a long time, and where you slowly make progress toward revealing what happened to the land, and how the darkess appeared. Also Darkest Dungeon II is currently in early access, so if you enjoyed the first, there's more where that came from! </p><br>
